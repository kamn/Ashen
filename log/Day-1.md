# Day 1 - 1st Nov 2016

Didn't get nearly enough done today but I got started.

[Declared my intent](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/70), made a [repo](https://github.com/kamn/Ashen) and even got a meaningless novel generated!
Spent a long time thinking of a name and also looking for an easy way to setup CLJS with node.
There does not seem to be a lot of up to date templates anymore :/.
Also started to brain storm ideas.
