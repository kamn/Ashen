# Day 7 -

A week has gone by and I have not got as far as I would have liked.
Today I worked on some more agent status factors.
I realize that I will need to work on locations next probably.

Some plans for the next 3 weeks.

Desire pivoting.
I want the agents to have their desires changed by events.
So Ash might have no desire but find one.
Or might meet another and

Plan conflict.
One idea for the plans is that each agent has a partial view of the world.
The plans they generate are incomplete and can fail.
How to merge these two realities.

I need 50,000 words.
I would like to generate a section of the story with 500 to 1000 words.

Investigate other's code.
I should have done this at the start but I would like to make a point of doing it.

Story expansion.
I want to be able to have the story auto expand.
Pin point the start state.
Pin point the end state.
Simulate everything in between.

Form.
Make the sentences nicer and better.

Just a outline.
Hopefully I can pull something close off.
